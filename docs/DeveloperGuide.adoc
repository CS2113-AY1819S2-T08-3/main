== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

* JDK 9 or later
* IntelliJ IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Importing the project into IntelliJ

. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. If JDK 9 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 9
.. Click `OK`
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Run the `planmysem.Main` class (right-click the `Main` class and click `Run Main.main()`) and try executing a few commands
. Run all the tests (right-click the `test` folder, and click `Run 'All Tests'`) and ensure that they pass
. Open the `StorageFile` file and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=java.xml.bind' to module compiler options`

== Testing

* In IntelliJ, right-click on the `test` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* has a need to manage a significant number of categories, activites, timeslots, tags in a calendar
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* prefers having an offline calendar
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* NUS students and staff

*Value proposition*: manage personal planner faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app and caters to users who prefer an offline solution due to the current technology climate where information privacy/data privacy/data protection has become an uncertainty

== Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the *System* is `PlanMySem` and the *Actor* is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

=== Use case: Initialize Calendar
. User inputs the first day of school as well as which semester, 1 or 2, that the planner is meant for.
. System generates a new timetable which is aligned with the academic semester. Weeks 1 to 13 as well as the Recess and Reading Weeks are labelled.
+
Use case ends.

=== Use Case: Add a Module
. User selects the category “Module” and inputs the details related to the new module.
. System reflects the addition made to the list of Modules.
+
User case ends.

=== Use Case: List and Delete a Module
. User inputs the command to list all modules he/she is enrolled in.
. System lists all the modules.
. User selects the intended module from the list and inputs the delete command along with the module name for deletion. 
+
Use case ends.

=== Use Case: Edit a Module
. User inputs command to edit a module along with the module name.
. System returns module name and it’s color attribute.
. User renames the module or changes the color attribute.

[appendix]
== Non Functional Requirements

. Should work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>> as long as it has Java 9 or higher installed.
. Should be able to hold up a fully packed schedule, three times over, without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
. The system should respond relatively quickly to user commands so as to not make the user wait around; this is an advantage of using PlanMySem.
. The system should take up relatively little space on the local machine so as to cater to all students and OS.
. The system should be easy to use, intuitive and simple, such that any student regardless of past experience with calendar/scheduling softwares is able to use it.
. The system should be flexible to allow all kinds of schedules that all users, within the user target, might have.

== Glossary

[[mainstream-os]] Mainstream OS::
Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X

Should only include this if we actually make any mention to private planner detail.
[[private-planner-detail]] Private planner detail::
Any data stored on to the planner is not meant to be shared with others, unless the data is willingly exported.
