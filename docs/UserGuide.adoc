== Introduction

Welcome to _PlanMySem_! Choose a topic from the table of contents to learn about available features with examples, find answers or view a summary of the commands.

_PlanMySem_ is a text-based (Command Line Interface) scheduling/calendar application that targets NUS students and staff who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their schedule/calendar.
_PlanMySem_ automatically creates a planner that is synchronised according to the NUS academic calendar for the current semester and enables easy creation, editing and deleting of items.
Special weeks such as recess week and reading week are taken into account within our unique recursion system.
Items can then be efficiently managed via the intuitive tagging system.

_PlanMySem_ is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and/or are learning to work more efficiently with CLI tools. Additionally, unlike traditional calendar/scheduling applications, _PlanMySem_ utilizes minimal resources on the user’s machine while still allowing the user to view their schedules swiftly and efficiently.

This user guide provides a quick start guide for you to easily setup and install _PlanMySem_, documentation of all the various features _PlanMySem_ offers, frequently asked questions and a summary of the available commands.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `planmysem.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your planner.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. You should see the GUI appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:


* **`add`**`n/CS2113T d/mon st/08:00 et/09:00 des/Topic: Sequence Diagram t/CS2113T t/Tutorial` : +
Add a slot, named "CS2113T" on the coming monday, from 0800hrs to 0900hrs with the tags "CS2113T" and "Tutorial".
* *`list`*`n/CS2113T` : list all slots named "CS2113T"

== Features

This section displays the current implemented features as well as features that will be implemented in the future.

[NOTE]
*For ease of communication, this document will refer to lessons/activities/events/appointments that you might add into the Planner as _slots_.*

====

*Tagging System*

Unlike other commercial calendar/scheduling/planner software, PlanMySem makes use of a tagging system to manage slots.

Using tags to tag slots will make tasks easier for you in the future. Tasks such as viewing, deleting and editing slots will be more efficient and performed quicker.

Recommended uses for tags:

1. Tag modules. e.g. "CS2113T", "CS2101".
2. Tag type of lesson. e.g. "Lecture", "Tutorial", "Lab".
3. Tag type of activities. e.g. "Sports", "Seminar", "Talk"
4. Tag difficulty of task. e.g. "Tough", "Simple", "Trivial"

*Recursion System*

Recursion facilitate quick addition of multiple slots, similar to Microsoft Outlook's series of appointments.

In NUS, academic semesters are split into weeks of several types. Recursion allows you to add slots to these types of weeks with ease through the use of the `r/` parameter.

*Parameters*

Parameters in _PlanMySem_ are designed to be, short and easy to memorise. Once you are familarised with them, they should be intuitive to use.
The list of parameters below is useful for your reference as you jump right into grasping the system.

*Command Format*

* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user. E.g. in `t/TAG`, `TAG` is a parameter which can be used as the name of the tag.
* Items in square brackets are optional. e.g in `add [l/LOCATION]`, `LOCATION` is a parameter that may be omited.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as   (i.e. 0 times), `t/lab`, `t/lecture`, `t/tutorial` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `st/START_TIME et/END_TIME d/DATE`, then both `et/09:00 st/08:00 d/2-13-2019` and `et/09:00 d/2-13-2019 st/08:00` is also acceptable.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: In order to transfer your data to another Computer, you should:

1. Install the app on the other computer +
2. Copy _PlanMySem.txt_ from your old _PlanMySem_ folder and paste it into the new _PlanMySem_ folder. +

This will overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous _PlanMySem_ folder.
