== Introduction

PlanMySem is a CLI (Command Line Interface) scheduling/calendar application that targets NUS students and staff who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their schedule/calendar.
PlanMySem automatically creates a planner that is synchronised according to the NUS academic calendar for the current semester and enables easy creation, editing and deleting of items.
Special weeks such as recess week and reading week are taken into account within our unique recursion system.
Items can then be efficiently managed via the intuitive tagging system.

PlanMySem is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and/or are learning to work more efficiently with CLI tools. Additionally, unlike traditional calendar/scheduling applications, PlanMySem utilizes minimal resources on the user’s machine while still allowing the user to view their schedules swiftly and efficiently.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `planmysem.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your planner.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
