== Introduction

Welcome to _PlanMySem_! Choose a topic from the table of contents to learn about available features with examples, find answers or view a summary of the commands.

_PlanMySem_ is a text-based (Command Line Interface) scheduling/calendar application that targets NUS students and staff who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their schedule/calendar.
_PlanMySem_ automatically creates a planner that is synchronised according to the NUS academic calendar for the current semester and enables easy creation, editing and deleting of items.
Special weeks such as recess week and reading week are taken into account within our unique recursion system.
Items can then be efficiently managed via the intuitive tagging system.

_PlanMySem_ is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and/or are learning to work more efficiently with CLI tools. Additionally, unlike traditional calendar/scheduling applications, _PlanMySem_ utilizes minimal resources on the user’s machine while still allowing the user to view their schedules swiftly and efficiently.

This user guide provides a quick start guide for you to easily setup and install _PlanMySem_, documentation of all the various features _PlanMySem_ offers, frequently asked questions and a summary of the available commands.

E.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`add`**`n/CS2113T d/mon st/08:00 et/09:00 des/Topic: Sequence Diagram t/CS2113T t/Tutorial` : +
Add a slot, named "CS2113T" on the coming monday, from 0800hrs to 0900hrs with the tags "CS2113T" and "Tutorial".
* *`list`*`n/CS2113T` : list all slots named "CS2113T"
* **`delete`**`3` : delete the 3rd slot shown in the current list

[[Features]]
== Features

This section displays the features of _PlanMySem_.

*Tagging System*

Unlike other commercial calendar/scheduling/planner software, _PlanMySem_ makes use of a tagging system to manage slots.

Using tags to tag slots will make tasks easier for you in the future. Performing tasks such as viewing, deleting and editing slots will be more efficient.

Recommended uses for tags:

1. Tag modules. E.g. "CS2113T", "CS2101".
2. Tag type of lesson. E.g. "Lecture", "Tutorial", "Lab".
3. Tag type of activities. E.g. "Sports", "Seminar", "Talk".
4. Tag difficulty of task. E.g. "Tough", "Simple", "Trivial".

*Recursion System*

Recursion facilitates quick addition of multiple slots, similar to Microsoft Outlook's series of appointments.

In NUS, academic semesters are split into weeks of several types. Recursion allows you to add slots to these types of weeks with ease through the use of the `r/`(recursion) parameter.

*Command Format*

* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user. E.g. in `t/TAG`, `TAG` is a parameter which can be used as the name of the tag.
* Items in square brackets are optional. e.g in `add [l/LOCATION]`, `LOCATION` is a parameter that may be omitted.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times. E.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used 0 times, or as `t/lab`, `t/lecture`, `t/tutorial` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. E.g. if the command specifies `st/START_TIME et/END_TIME d/DATE`, then both `et/09:00 st/08:00 d/2-13-2019` and `et/09:00 d/2-13-2019 st/08:00` are acceptable.

[TIP]
You can save time by utilizing the alternate and shortcut commands. E.g. instead of using `delete`, you may also use `del` or simply `d`.

*Identifiers and Parameters*

Identifiers in _PlanMySem_ are designed to be, short and easy to memorise.
Once you are familiarised with them, they should be intuitive to use to add your parameters.
The table of Identifiers and Parameters and their descriptions (Table 1) below is useful for your reference as you jump right into grasping the system.
