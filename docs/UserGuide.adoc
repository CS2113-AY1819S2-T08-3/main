== Introduction

PlanMySem is a CLI (Command Line Interface) scheduling/calendar application that targets NUS students and staff who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their schedule/calendar. PlanMySem automatically creates a calendar and synchronises it according to the NUS academic calendar for a particular semester.

PlanMySem is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and/or are learning to work more efficiently with CLI tools. Additionally, unlike traditional calendar/scheduling applications, PlanMySem utilizes minimal resources on the user’s machine while still allowing the user to view their schedules swiftly and efficiently.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `planmysem.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your planner.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
