== PROJECT: PlanMySem

---

== Overview

This portfolio documents my contributions to *PlanMySem*, an application that was morphed from https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main[AddressBook Level 3]
into a scheduling/calendar application that caters to NUS students and staff.

In summary, *PlanMySem* offers the following features:

* Automatic creation of a planner that is synchronized to the NUS academic calendar for the current semester.
* Quick and easy slot management (adding, editing and deleting of slots). This is achieved via two systems.
    ** A unique recursion system which takes into account special weeks such as recess week or reading week to allow efficient adding of recurring items.
    ** An intuitive tagging system to manage large amount of slots productively.
* Optimized for you if you prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and/or are learning to work more efficiently with CLI tools.
* Utilizes minimal resources on your machine while still allowing you to view your schedules swiftly.

It was developed as part of CS2113T, a software engineering module in the National University of Singapore (NUS), and consisted of 4 partners, <<marcus-pzj#, Marcus>>, <<macchazuki#, Jullian>>, <<dingheng4448#, Ding Heng>>
and myself; in which I served as the team lead. I was responsible for the slot management feature (add, edit and delete commands) and the structure of the codebase.

The next sections will illustrate these enhancements in more detail as well as the respective changes that I have made to both the user guide and developer guide.
Lastly, kindly take not that throughout this portfolio, there will be various icons used as described as such.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

* *Major enhancements*:
    ** Feature 1: I implemented the slot management system, including the recursion and tagging system, of *PlanMySem*.
        *** What it does: Slot management composes of the three interactions that users are able to perform regarding slots.
            As such, slot management are the parsing and execution of the add, edit and delete commands and its functions.
        *** Justification: Slot management is a basic feature of *PlanMySem*, it is a necessity of the application. Without so,
            the planner cannot be manipulated nor interacted with.
        *** Highlights: This enhancement involved many variables and data types due to the nature of slots and its details.
            As such, this enhancement involved a large amount of cases, same was the came as with its tests. Additionally, to cater
            to user experience and ease of use, several variations of each functions were done up.

    ** Feature 2: I implemented a new parsing system to replace the existing system for both prefixed parameters and keywords.
        *** What it does: It parses commands input by the user and determines the user intention, hence determining what action
            is to be taken by the application.
        *** Justification: A new parser with flexible reading of prefixed parameters allows for unordered parameters instead of fixed ordering
            in the old parse. This way, new parser allow for greater ease of use and overall user experience.
        *** Highlights: The implementation of this feature required taking care of numerous cases in an effective manner. It
            was a tedious and slow process but necessary.

* *Minor enhancement*:
    ** Mini-Feature 1: I implemented a new clock system to manage dates and time more efficiently as with the nature of a planner application, the application is very time sensitive.

== Contributions to the User Guide
This section shows my contributions I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users.

== Features
This section displays the available features of *PlanMySem* together with examples for you to refer to.

*Tagging System*

Unlike other commercial calendar/scheduling/planner software, *PlanMySem* makes use of a tagging system to manage _slots_.

Using tags to tag _slots_ will make tasks easier for you in the future. Performing tasks such as viewing, deleting and editing _slots_ will be more efficient.

Recommended uses for tags:

1. Tag modules. E.g. "CS2113T", "CS2101".
2. Tag type of lesson. E.g. "Lecture", "Tutorial", "Lab".
3. Tag type of activities. E.g. "Sports", "Seminar", "Talk".
4. Tag difficulty of task. E.g. "Tough", "Simple", "Trivial".

*Recursion System*

Recursion facilitates quick addition of multiple _slots_, similar to Microsoft Outlook's series of appointments.

In NUS, academic semesters are split into weeks of several types. Recursion allows you to add _slots_ to these types of weeks with ease through the use of the `r/`(recursion) parameter.

*Command Format*

* Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user. E.g. in `t/TAG`, `TAG` is a parameter which can be used as the name of the tag.
* Items in square brackets are optional. e.g in `add [l/LOCATION]`, `LOCATION` is a parameter that may be omitted.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times. E.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used 0 times, or as `t/lab`, `t/lecture`, `t/tutorial` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. E.g. if the command specifies `st/START_TIME et/END_TIME d/DATE`, then both `et/09:00 st/08:00 d/2-13-2019` and `et/09:00 d/2-13-2019 st/08:00` are acceptable.

[TIP]
You can save time by utilizing the alternate and shortcut commands. E.g. instead of using `delete`, you may also use `del` or simply `d`.

*Identifiers and Parameters*

Identifiers in *PlanMySem* are designed to be, short and easy to memorise.
Once you are familiarised with them, they should be intuitive to use to add your parameters.
The table of Identifiers and Parameters and their descriptions (Table 1) below is useful for your reference as you jump right into grasping the system.

.Identifiers and their Parameters and descriptions.
[width="100%",cols="5%,<10%,<30%,<30%,<25",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Identifier |Parameter |Description |Format |Example

.2+|`n/`
    |`NAME` |Name of a _slot_ |Text |`n/CS2113T`
    |`KEYWORD` |Text that are part of the name of a _slot_ |Text |`n/CS`
|`l/` |`LOCATION` |Location of a _slot_ |Text |`l/COM2 04-22`
|`des/` |`DESCRIPTION` |Description of a _slot_ |Text |`des/Topic: Abstraction`
|`t/` |`TAG` |Tag of a _slot_ |Text |`t/Lab`
5+|_Further rows are omitted due to space constrains_
|=======================================================================

[TIP]
You may order identifiers and parameters in any fashion and you will still be able to achieve what you want!
So, do not bother thinking about where to place parameters as ordering does not matter, instead become more efficient and save your time!

[IMPORTANT]
Identifiers may be appended with a `n` to dictate "new". +
E.g. `nt/NEW_TAG` signifies new tags in which you want to replace existing tags with.

[CAUTION]
While table 1 shows you all the identifiers and parameters that *PlanMySem* uses, there are some commands that do not make use of identifiers nor parameters.
The view command is one such exception that make use of keywords that must be typed in a specific order.

=== Adding Slots : `add` / `a`
Add _slot(s)_ to the planner. +
Format: `add n/NAME d/DATE_OR_DAY_OF_WEEK st/START_TIME et/END_TIME_OR_DURATION +
[l/LOCATION] [des/DESCRIPTION] [r/normal] [r/recess] [r/reading] [r/exam] [r/past] [t/TAG]...`

Examples:

* `add n/CS2113T Tutorial d/mon st/8:00 am et/9:00 am des/Topic: Sequence Diagram t/CS2113T t/Tutorial` +
Add a single _slot_, named "CS2113T Tutorial" on the coming monday, from 0800hrs to 0900hrs with the tags "CS2113T" and "Tutorial".

_There is am image here that is omitted due to space constrains, click {repoURL}/docs/images/Add_Command_Output_1.png[`here`] to view it._

* `add n/CS2113T Tutorial d/mon st/08:00 et/09:00 des/Topic: Sequence Diagram t/CS2113T t/Tutorial r/recess r/reading` +
Do the same but additionally, recurse the _slot_ on both recess and reading week.

* `add n/CS2113T Tutorial d/mon st/08:00 et/09:00 des/Topic: Sequence Diagram t/CS2113T t/Tutorial r/normal` +
Do the same but recurse the _slot_ on "normal", instructional, weeks.

[TIP]
You may add single _slots_ by omitting the `r/` identifiers and its parameters.

[[edit]]
=== Editing Slots: `edit` / `e`
Edit _slot(s)_.

1. Edit _slot(s)_ which contains certain _tag_(s). +
Format: `edit t/TAG... [nn/NEW_NAME] [nst/NEW_START_TIME] [net/NEW_END_TIME|DURATION] [nl/NEW_LOCATION] [nd/NEW_DESCRIPTION] [nt/NEW_TAG]...`
2. Edit specific _slot_ via the `list` command. +
Format: `edit INDEX [nn/NEW_NAME] [nd/NEW_DATE] [nst/NEW_START_TIME] [net/NEW_END_TIME|DURATION] [nl/NEW_LOCATION] [nd/NEW_DESCRIPTION] [nt/NEW_TAG]...`

[NOTE]
You will not be able to edit a _slot_'s date when editing via _tags_. +
To edit a _slot_'s date, you may use the `list` or `find` command and edit specific _slot(s)_ via index.

Examples:

* `edit t/CS2113T t/Tutorial nl/COM2 04-01` +
Edit _slots_ that contain tags "CS2113T" and "Tutorial", set these _slot's_ location to "COM2 04-01".

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=parserformatstructure]

=== Parser / Command Format and Structure

Due to the flexibility and huge variation of the envisioned command format and structures, it was decided that it was more appropriate to create a new Parser
instead of relying on the existing regex implementation in AB3 for heavy parsing.

The AB3 parser was heavily modified to serve unordered command parameters as well as to allow more flexibility such that mistakes in commands will still be
interpreted as valid as long as the "minimal" set of parameters are present. Regex is currently only used to retrieve the command keywords and arguments.
Arguments are then parsed via 2 different methods/techniques according to the format and structure of the command keyword.

==== Current Implementation

* Ordering of parameters are ignored when possible.
* Repeated parameters are ignored. The first parameter of the same "type" are taken as valid, the rest are discarded.
* Alternate formats of commands are implemented to give freedom of choice and cater to different types of users such as different personalities and comfort levels.
* Shortened versions of command keywords are implemented to give ways for users to shortened commands and be more efficient.

Hence, parameters in *PlanMySem* can be categorised into 2 categories:

1. Prefixed parameters such as `n/NAME`, `st/START_TIME`, `des/DESCRIPTION`, etc.
2. Non-Prefixed parameters, A.K.A. keywords, such as `INDEX`, `TYPE_OF_VIEW`. etc.

===== Parsing Prefixed Parameters

To retrieve the set of parameters, the function `private static HashMap<String, Set<String>> getParametersWithArguments(String args)` can be called.
The function returns a `HashMap` data structure, specifically `HashMap<String, Set<String>>`, to hold parameters, allowing for easy, quick and efficient access to specific prefixes and its keyed in parameters; O(1) access, insertion and removal.

However, this means that exceptions have to be manually taken care of, at the stage of parsing, this exception would particularly be `ParseException`.

The following are cases in which `ParseException` is invoked:

* When the returned set is `null`, then the prefix and parameters was not keyed in at all.
* When the returned set is not `null` but contains empty `strings` such that `string.isEmpty()`, then the prefix was keyed in but was left empty on purpose.

===== Parsing Keywords

Here, keywords are thought of as parameters that are not prefixed.
In *PlanMySem*, keywords are utilized in command structures when they are to be used alone or when order of parameters are important.
In such cases, there is no logical need for prefixing as the meaning of these parameters can be identified.

The function `private String getStartingArgument(String args)` provides this functionality.
Here, `IncorrectCommand` is invoked due to different circumstances:

* When the keyword is null, then the parameter was not keyed in.
* When the keyword data type does not match the intended, then the parameter was keyed in wrongly or is mis-ordered.

[NOTE]
Additional keywords are purposefully *not* handled to provide ease of use and cater to user mistakes.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Handling repeated parameters

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Accept and ignore repeated parameters when possible.
** Pros: Less Computationally expensive and allows users to make minor mistakes.
** Cons: User errors may be misinterpreted and hence wrong actions may be executed.

* *Alternative 2:* Accept repeated parameters only when as necessary.
** Pros: Errors are shown to the user so that the invalid command may be fixed.
** Cons: May hinder user experience, ease of use.

===== Aspect: Handling order of parameters

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Parse parameters without regards to order.
** Pros: Greater user experience due to greater ease of use.
** Cons: More computationally expensive and tougher development process due to more cases to care for, requires manual parsing.

* *Alternative 2:* Accept only a specific ordering of parameters.
** Pros: Less computationally expensive and short development process, able to use existing regex solutions in AB3.
** Cons: Greatly hinder user experience as order of parameters have no relation to meaning of commands.

==== Future Implementation

Though the current implementation has much flexibility, there is more that can be done to elevate user experience to the next level.
These are some possible enhancements:

1. Parse more formats of date and time.
2. Parse time as a single parameter instead of two.
3. Enhance function calls to retrieve prepended parameters and keywords to handle trivial cases that should invoke `IncorrectCommand`.

=== Slot Management

_Slot_ Management involves mainly the interaction between the users and their _slots_.

The section below will describe in detail the Current Implementation, Design Considerations and Future Implementation of the Slot Management.

==== Current Implementation

Users are able to perform three actions (or commands), though a small variety of methods, involving _slots_:

* `Add`
    ** Add multiple slots via the _recursion_ system.
    ** Add a single slot via omitting the _recursion_ system.
* `Edit`
    ** Edit multiple _slots_ via _tags_.
    ** Edit a single _slot_ via _index_.
* `Delete`
    ** Delete _slots_ via _tags_.
    ** Delete a single _slot_ via _index_.

The `Add` command heavily relies on the _recursion_ system to select multiple dates in which to add the same slot to multiple days.
Additionally, the `Add` command also allows users to input _tags_ to tag _slots_.

The `Edit` and `Delete` command then makes use of the _tagging_ system to then select multiple slots for editing/deleting.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Wrapping of primitive data types in `Slot`

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Use of "primitive" data types instead of creating and utilising wrapped objects. +
E.g. `name`, `location` amd `description` are not wrapped but "primitive".
** Pros: Allows for more flexible code to account for flexible parsing (as needed in this application).
** Cons: Bigger code base and duplicated code.

* *Alternative 2:* Wrap "primitive" data types.
** Pros: Less errors in handling invalid values.
** Cons: May cause inflexibility in writing code to account for flexible parsing.

In summary, in this cause of *PlanMySem*, there is a need to achieve varied and flexible commands and as such,
it is not necessary to handle invalid values with the innate `Model` objects as these are taken care of when parsing.

Additionally, doing these actions when parsing, though bloats code, allows for more varied responses to the user and improves user experience.

===== Aspect: Storing and accessing `Slots`

* *Alternative 1 (current implementation):* Use of `Map`, such as `HashMap` to store `Days` that store `Slots`.
** Pros: `HashMap` allows for easier and faster, O(1) access time, access of particular `Day` according to date.
** Cons: This requires splitting of the calendar into days, as such there is no easy way to account for `Slots` that occur across days.

* *Alternative 2:* Store `Slots` in a huge list.
** Pros: Allows for easier access by "index" and offers flexibility, for example, in the time of slots.
** Cons: Expensive to access, add and remove items. Furthermore, it is extremely expensive to collect slots that occur in a day, a very important and most likely to be a commonly used feature.

==== Future Implementation

===== Create a class to hold `Days`, instead of utilising a `HashMap`

Currently, `Days` are held in a HashMap of key `LocalDate` and value `Day`. While this works without any loss in performance, this causes duplication of code and removes some key concepts of abstraction.
For example, there are code blocks dedicated to retrieving days or slots that could have been placed into this new class. This is an issue as these code have nothing to do with for instance, `Semester` but they are placed there.

Therefore, this needs to be implemented in the future to achieve less coupling, more cohesion and respect the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open-Closed Principle (OCP) and Separation of Concerns Principle (SoC).

===== `Planner` to hold multiple `Semesters`

While *PlanMySem* now allow users to work on the current semester, it is unable to cater to future semesters. For instance when a semester is about to end, users are not able to plan ahead for the coming semester.

This is an issue that plagues user experience and is a significant problem. To solve this issue, `Planner` needs to hold multiple semesters in a `List` and more features need to be included to allow saving, loading and switching of semesters and etc.
