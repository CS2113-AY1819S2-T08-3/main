== PROJECT: PlanMySem

My team and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface addressbook application, https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main[AddressBook Level 3], for our Software Engineering project. +

We chose to morph it into a student planner called *PlanMySem*. This planner is made specially for NUS students and staff, containing features that will help them manage their school schedules more easily. +

*PlanMySem* is automatically synchronised according to the current semester of the NUS academic calendar.
Special weeks such as recess week and reading week are taken into account within our unique recursion system.

This allows students and staff to easily keep track of school related matters such as classes, deadlines and examinations.
These activities can also be efficiently managed via the intuitive tagging system. The user can then view his schedule for the day or week (shown in Fig. 1), or view the current semester.

[IMPORTANT]
This is a sign-post dictating important information. These are information that you will surely need to know to use *PlanMySem* efficiently.

[CAUTION]
This is a sign-post informing caution. Please take note of these items and exercise some care.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of the features I have implemented in *PlanMySem* as well as some details regarding the implementation.

* *Major enhancement 1*: I added the ability to *import .ics files*
** What it does: allows the user to import .ics files obtained from this or other applications.
[TIP]
.ics stands for a iCalendar file format. .ics files are one of the most commonly used calendar formats in applications such as Google Calendar and Outlook.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user can import existing appointments on other calendar applications into PlanMySem, allowing him to combine external appointments with his school schedule.
** Highlights: This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. In particular, this enhancement works hand-in-hand with 2 features that I will go into detail later: exporting and data and encryption.
An in-depth analysis of the add command was necessary to understand how slots are added into our planner as I had to add multiple slots into the planner at once.
** Code available https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main/blob/master/src/planmysem/logic/commands/ImportCommand.java[here]
{zwsp}

* *Major enhancement 2*: I added the ability to *export .ics files*
** What it does: allows the user to export .ics files from the planner  ** What it does: allows the user to export .ics files from the planner
** Justification: This feature improves the product because the user can export current slots in the planner and merge them into other calendar applications. The user can also export the .ics file to be imported across devices.
** Highlights: This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. In particular, this enhancement works hand-in-hand with the import feature described above. This allows the user to export a file that can be imported into PlanMySem on another device.
This enhancement also allows the user to obtain a readable file as the data will be encrypted (discussed later). +
An in-depth analysis of how the planner stores slots was necessary in order to extract their details to be exported.
** Code available https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main/blob/master/src/planmysem/logic/commands/ExportCommand.java[here]
{zwsp}

* *Minor enhancement*: I added data encryption of the storage file.
** What it does: the planner automatically encrypts the data before saving it into a .txt file. This data is then decrypted before being loaded by the application.
** Justification: This feature improves the product because the user's schedule data will not be able to easily obtained by others.
** Highlights: This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. In particular, this enhancement works hand-in-hand with the import and export functions. As we have decided to encrypt the raw data file, the user will not be able to obtain the raw data of his planner. +
As a result, the export function allows the user to obtain a read-able text file when he wishes to. +
This enhancement also allows the user to obtain a readable file as the data will be encrypted (discussed later). +
An in-depth analysis of how the planner data is stored was necessary to identify where encryption and decryption should be done on the data. Also, a general understanding of ciphers and data encryption was necessary in implementation of this enhancement.

[[encrypt]]
=== Encrypting/decrypting data files
Planner data is automatically encrypted before saving and decrypted before loading. You do not need to encrypt or decrypt the data manually.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

[[export]]
=== Exporting .ics formatted files: `export`
You can export the planner as a .ics file.
Format: `export [fn/FILE_NAME]/`

[NOTE]
====
The default name of the exported file is "PlanMySem.ics" and is saved in the main directory.
The .ics file can be imported into other calendar apps that support .ics files such as Google Calendar. +

[TIP]
A file with the ICS file extension is an iCalendar file.
These are plain text files that include calendar event details like a description, beginning and ending times, location, etc.
{zwsp}

[[import]]
=== Importing native .ics files `import`
You can import a .ics file generated by *PlanMySem* into the current planner.
Format: `import [fn/FILE_NAME]/`

[WARNING]
====
This feature is to allow transfer of data between *PlanMySem* on different devices. This feature is NOT for importing non-native .ics files.

Below is an example of my contributions in design considerations.

Data Exporting / Exporting feature

The user can export the current planner into a .ics file to use in external calendar applications. The .ics file will contain the names of the slots in the SUMMARY field and the descriptions in the DESCRIPTION field. This command automatically exports into the main directory and names the file “PlanMySem.ics”. Future updates can include user input to allow saving the file in another directory and naming the file.

We have chosen to use the iCalendar format due to its popularity and it’s use in applications such as Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook and NUSmods.

In our implementation, we have chosen not to export the tags into the .ics file. This is because iCalendar does not have in-built tag fields. This means that other applications that import .ics will not be able to use the tags.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

**Aspect: Exporting tags into .ics file.**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Ignore tags when exporting.

** Pros: Easier to implement as iCalendar does not have in-built tag fields.**

Cons: Not all the information about the slots will be retained.

**Reason for choice: We do not have much control over other applications, and importing and exporting .ics within *PlanMySem* can be done using the storageFile .txt file.**

**Alternative 2:** Use the notes field and a tag identifier to save the tags.

** Pros: All the information from the semester will be exported.**

Cons: Requires other applications to be coded to read these tag identifiers and also to store and use the tags in their functions.
