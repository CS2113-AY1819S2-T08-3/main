== PROJECT: PlanMySem

---

== Overview
Hi! I am Marcus Phua and I am currently a Year 2 Computer Engineering undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
This is where I document my contributions to *PlanMySem*.

For our Software Engineering project, my team and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface address book  application. +

We chose to morph it into a text-based (Command Line Interface) scheduling/calendar application called *PlanMySem*, which caters to NUS students and staff who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their schedule/calendar. +

*PlanMySem* automatically creates a planner that is synchronised according to the NUS academic calendar for the current semester and enables easy creation, editing and deleting of items.
Special weeks such as recess week and reading week are taken into account within our unique recursion system.
Items can then be efficiently managed via the intuitive tagging system. +

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

This symbol indicates important information. +

Also take note: +

|`list` | A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.
|[blue]`VersionedPlanner`| Blue text with grey highlight indicates a component, class, method or object in the architecture of the application.
|===

My role was to design and write the codes for the `list`, `find`, `history`, `undo` and `redo` features.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as
the relevant sections I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project. +

* *Main Feature*: I implemented the searching framework within the [blue]`Planner`. The searching framework
comprises of 2 sections:

** **List**: I added the ability to *search and list [blue]`Slots`* using a keyword user input.
*** What it does: The `list` command *generates a list* containing all [blue]`Slots` whose name/tag *directly matches* the specified keyword (not case-sensitive).
*** Justification: After the user has added [blue]`Slots` to their planner, they may want to be able to view information regarding
a [blue]`Slot` that they have added. If the user wants to find out the dates, start times, end times, venues and descriptions pertaining to a specific [blue]`Slot`, they can use the `list` command to
locate that specific [blue]`Slot` and view all of its information in a list.

** **Find**: I added the ability to *search and find [blue]`Slots`* using a keyword user input.
*** What it does: The `find` command *generates a list* containing all [blue]`Slots` whose name *closely matches* the specified keyword and displays them as a list.
*** Justification: Unlike the `list` command, the `find` command will also consider searches that are similar to the desired name/tag. This is to account for a typo or an incomplete keyword, which can happen often while the user is typing.
Additionally, the user may not remember the exact name he has added to the planner, and hence, the `find` command provides a higher chance for the user to locate their desired [blue]`Slot`.
[IMPORTANT]
The `find` command ends up generating a longer output list, which potentially contains many [blue]`Slots`, which may not be optimal for the user to skim through. Thus, I provide users with the option to use the `list` command to specifically pinpoint their desired [blue]`Slot` to list.
*** Highlights: It was challenging to provide an optimal string matching algorithm that accurately weighs the closeness of strings.
An in-depth analysis of design alternatives was necessary to determine the kind of string matching algorithm to implement in order to improve search accuracy.
*** Credits: The string matching logic was largely dependent on the <<levenshtein-distance,Levenshtein Distance>> algorithm.

* *Minor Feature*: I added the ability to *undo/redo previous commands* and *view the history* of commands entered.
*** What it does: The `undo` command allows the user to undo a previous `add`/`edit`/`delete` command. The user may reverse this command with the `redo` command.
*** Justification: In the event that users have made a mistake or changed their minds about executing
                  a command, the `undo` command enables them to revert to a version immediately before
                  the mistaken command was executed. If they change their minds again and decide to
                  execute the command after all, then the `redo` command enables them to do so easily.
*** Highlights: As our group chose to morph the product from https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S2/addressbook-level3[AddressBook 3], we did not have a History framework in place. I took up the responsibility
to adapt the History Framework provided in https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[AddressBook 4] in order to cater to our implementation of *PlanMySem*.
*** Credits: https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[AddressBook 4] for providing the History framework.

To get a sense of how all these features function together, the activity diagram below shows how the search workflow for a [blue]`Slot` in *PlanMySem* looks like:

.[.underline]#Activity Diagram for Search workflow#
image::FindListHistoryActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

Essentially, if the user knows the exact keyword to use to locate his/her desired [blue]`Slot`, he would use the `list` command.
Otherwise, the `find` command is recommended for use. As a parallel process, [blue]`CommandHistory` records the user input and saves it to [blue]`Planner's` history.

== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. I have added the descriptions of all features that I have implemented.
I have also provided clear instructions for users to use my implemented features._
|===

Here are the links to my contributed sections in the User Guide:

- List Command: https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#list[`list`] +
- Find Command: https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#find[`find`] +
- History Command: https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#history[`history`] +
- Undo Command: https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#undo[`undo`] +
- Redo Command: https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#redo[`redo`]

Below is an example of my addition to the User Guide for the `find` feature.

=== Finding Slots: `find` / `f`
Find all _slots_ whose name closely matches the specified keyword and displays them as a list. (Case-sensitive) +
Format: `find n/KEYWORD`

[CAUTION]
Keywords are case sensitive! (e.g. _CS2113T_ is not the same as _cs2113t_)

[NOTE]
The `find` command will return the closest matching `Slot` which contains the specified keyword. **The name/tag MUST
contain the specified keyword in order for a match to occur**.

[TIP]
Use short keywords (e.g CS) instead of long keywords to increase the chances of finding your desired slot. +
E.g. Let's say you are finding a `Slot` named _Golf_. +
`find n/Go` will detect the slot, while `find n/Golfs` will fail to detect the slot. (Golf does not contain Golfs) +

Example:

* `find n/CS` +
Find all _slots_ whose name closely matches `CS` (eg. CS2101, CS2113T, SOCSMeet)

* `find t/2113T` +
Find all _slots_ that contain tags that closely matches `2113T`.

.[.underline]#Output after entering `find n/CS`#
image::Find_Command_Output.png[width="790"]

Explanation: As seen from the figure above, the output list of slots are ranked according to their degree of similarity.
All of the `Slots` listed contain the keyword _'CS'_. +
Since _'JSOCS'_ has less characters, it is considered closest to the keyword _'CS'_, which has only 2 characters. +
Remember the tip above when you are finding your `Slots`.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. I have explained the logic behind the features that were tasked to me.
I have also elaborated on my design considerations in order to justify my implementation style. +

In addition, I was tasked with collating and polishing the User Stories which were generated during the ideation phase of the project._
|===

Here are the links to my contributed sections in the Developer Guide:

- List Command: https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#list-feature[`list`]
- Find Command: https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#find-feature[`find`]
- Undo & Redo Command: https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#undo-redo-feature[`undo` & `redo`]
- User Stories: https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#user-stories[User Stories]

Below is an example of my addition to the Developer Guide for the `find` feature.

=== Find feature

==== Current Implementation
The find function supports searching using a single keyword. +

[NOTE]
The name/tag of the [blue]`Slot` MUST contain the specified keyword in order for a match to occur. Completely different keywords
do not constitute a match. +

The matching [blue]`Slots` are then weighted based on their name/tag's <<levenshtein-distance,Levenshtein Distance>> from the keyword.

[TIP]
A low <<levenshtein-distance,Levenshtein Distance>> is attributed to a high level of similarity between the name/tag and the keyword.
(A value of 0 constitutes an exact match.) +
The maximum Levenshtein Distance set in *PlanMySem* is 20.

The weighted [blue]`Slots` are inserted into a [blue]`PriorityQueue` and the closest matching [blue]`Slots`
will be polled into the output list. +

Upon executing the `find` command with valid parameters (refer to <<UserGuide#view, UserGuide.adoc>> for `find` usage),
a sequence of events is executed. The sequence of events illustrated in the Sequence Diagram below will be in reference to the execution
of a `find n/keyword` command. The sequence of events are as follows:

1. Upon calling the [blue]`execute` method of the [blue]`Logic` component, the [blue]`Logic` component would then parse the `find n/keyword`
command.
2. This results in a [blue]`FindCommand` object which is executed with name parameter 'keyword' and null tag.
3. The command execution will call the [blue]`getDays` method of the [blue]`FindCommand` object which retrieves data from the
[blue]`Model` component (i.e. retrieving data from the current [blue]`Semester`). +
4. [blue]`FindCommand` will execute the [blue]`getDiscoveredNames` method to find the closely matching [blue]`Slots` with names containing 'keyword'.
5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a [blue]`CommandResult` object which is passed back to [blue]`Ui`.
6. In addition, the [blue]`CommandResult` object can also instruct the [blue]`Ui` to display results, such as displaying help to
the user.

To give a graphical summary of the above process, a Sequence Diagram detailing the execution of the `find n/keyword` command is provided below.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: What constitutes a positive search result in `find` command

|===
|**No.**|**Alternatives** |**Pros** |**Cons**
|**Past Implementation 1** |Positive search result by strictly matching the entered keyword |Easy to implement. |Search must be exact, typos or an incomplete keyword will yield incorrect results. Nothing different from `List` feature.
|**Past Implementation 2** |Positive search result as long as name/tag contains the keyword.|Searches will detect names/tags similar to the keyword. |Output list will be longer. May become excessively long if short keyword is provided.
|**Current Implementation** |Store the search results in a `PriorityQueue` ordered by their <<levenshtein-distance,Levenshtein distances>> from the search keyword.|Searches are ordered by a degree of similarity, instead of the random order of names/tags in Past Implementation 2.|Adds complexities in finding and searching.

== Glossary

[[levenshtein-distance]] Levenshtein Distance::
The Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring difference between two sequences. +
Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (i.e. insertions, deletions or substitutions)
required to change one word into the other.
