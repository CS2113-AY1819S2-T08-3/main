== PROJECT: PlanMySem

---

== Overview

For our Software Engineering project, my team and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line interface address book  application. +

We chose to morph it into a text-based (Command Line Interface) scheduling/calendar application called *PlanMySem*, which caters to NUS students and staff who prefer to use a desktop application for managing their schedule/calendar. +

*PlanMySem* automatically creates a planner that is synchronised according to the NUS academic calendar for the current semester and enables easy creation, editing and deleting of items.
Special weeks such as recess week and reading week are taken into account within our unique recursion system.
Items can then be efficiently managed via the intuitive tagging system. +

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

|[blue]`VersionedPlanner`| Blue text with grey highlight indicates a component, class or object in the architecture of the application.

My role was to design and write the codes for the `list`, `find`, `history`, `undo` and `redo` features.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as
the relevant sections I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project. +

* *Major enhancements*:
** Feature 1: I added the ability to *undo/redo previous commands* and *view the history* of commands entered.
*** What it does: The `undo` command allows the user to undo a previous `add`/`edit`/`delete` command. The user may reverse this command with the `redo` command.
*** Justification: In the event that users have made a mistake or changed their minds about executing
                  a command, the `undo` command enables them to revert to a version immediately before
                  the mistaken command was executed. If they change their minds again and decide to
                  execute the command after all, then the `redo` command enables them to do so easily.
*** Highlights: As our group chose to morph the product from https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S2/addressbook-level3[AddressBook 3], we did not have a History framework in place. I took up the responsibility
to adapt the History Framework provided in https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[AddressBook 4] in order to cater to our implementation of *PlanMySem*.
*** Credits: https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[AddressBook 4] for providing the History framework.

** Feature 2: I added the ability to *search and list [blue]`Slots`* using a keyword user input.
*** What it does: The `list` command *generates a list* containing all [blue]`Slots` whose name/tag *directly matches* the specified keyword (not case-sensitive).
*** Justification: After the user has added [blue]`Slots` to their planner, they may want to be able to view information regarding
a [blue]`Slot` that they have added. If the user wants to find out the dates, start times, end times, venues and descriptions pertaining to a specific [blue]`Slot`, they can use the `list` command to
locate that specific [blue]`Slot` and view all of its information in a list.

** Feature 3: I added the ability to *search and find [blue]`Slots`* using a keyword user input.
*** What it does: The `find` command *generates a list* containing all [blue]`Slots` whose name *closely matches* the specified keyword and displays them as a list.
*** Justification: Unlike the `list` command, the `find` command will also consider searches that are similar to the desired name/tag. This is to account for a typo or an incomplete keyword, which can happen often while the user is typing.
Additionally, the user may not remember the exact name he has added to the planner, and hence, the `find` command provides a higher chance for the user to locate their desired [blue]`Slot`.
[IMPORTANT]
The `find` command ends up generating a longer output list, which potentially contains many [blue]`Slots`, which may not be optimal for the user to skim through. Thus, I provide users with the option to use the `list` command to specifically pinpoint their desired [blue]`Slot` to list.
*** Highlights: It was challenging to provide an optimal string matching algorithm that accurately weighs the closeness of strings.
An in-depth analysis of design alternatives was necessary to determine the kind of string matching algorithm to implement in order to improve search accuracy.
*** Credits: The string matching logic was largely dependent on <<levenshtein-distance,Levenshtein Distance>>. My implementation was adapted from https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance#Java[Rosetta Code].

== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. I have added the descriptions of all features that I have implemented.
I have also provided clear instructions for users to use my implemented features._

Below is an example of my addition to the User Guide for the `find` feature.

=== Locating Slots: `find` / `f`
Find all [blue]`Slots` whose name closely matches the specified keyword and displays them as a list. +
Format: `find n/KEYWORD`

[IMPORTANT]
The `find` command will attempt to return the closest matching [blue]`Slot` in the event that a match is not found.
Do not be surprised to _eg. enter `find n/ABC` and get a [blue]`Slot` named `XYZ`_ in return.

Example:

* `find n/CS` +
Find all [blue]`Slots` whose name contains `CS` (eg. CS2101, CS2113T, SOCSMeet)

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. I have explained the logic behind the features that were tasked to me.
I have also elaborated on my design considerations in order to justify my implementation style. +

In addition, I was tasked with collating and polishing the User Stories which were generated during the ideation phase of the project._

Below is an example of my addition to the Developer Guide for the `find` feature.

=== Find feature

==== Current Implementation
The find function supports searching using a single keyword. +
All existing `Slots` are weighted based on their name/tag's <<levenshtein-distance,Levenshtein Distance>> from the keyword.

A low <<levenshtein-distance,Levenshtein Distance>> is attributed to a high level of similarity between the name/tag and the keyword.
(A value of 0 constitutes an exact match.)

The weighted [blue]`Slots` are inserted into a [blue]`PriorityQueue` and the closest matching [blue]`Slots`
will be polled into the output list. +

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: What constitutes a positive search result in `find` command

|===
|**Alternatives** |**Pros** |**Cons**
|**1:** Positive search result by strictly matching the entered keyword |Easy to implement. |Search must be exact, typos or an incomplete keyword will yield incorrect results. Nothing different from `List` feature.
|**2:** Positive search result as long as name/tag contains the keyword.|Searches will detect names/tags similar to the keyword. |Output list will be longer. May become excessively long if short keyword is provided.
|**3 (current implementation):** Store the search results in a `PriorityQueue` ordered by their <<levenshtein-distance,Levenshtein distances>> from the search keyword.|Will also consider searches that are similar to the desired name/tag and will account for a typo or an incomplete keyword|Adds complexities in finding and searching.

== Glossary

[[levenshtein-distance]] Levenshtein Distance::
The Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring difference between two sequences. +
Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (i.e. insertions, deletions or substitutions)
required to change one word into the other.
