== PROJECT: PlanMySem

Hello there! I am Lim Ding Heng, a Year 2 Information Security undergraduate at the National University of Singapore and
will be graduating in 2020. This portfolio documents my contributions to the project,
https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main[*PlanMySem*], which was developed together with my team;
<<marcus-pzj#, Marcus>>, <<macchazuki#, Julian>>, and <<seanieyap#, Sean>>.

== Overview

My team and I have morphed the original https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S2/addressbook-level3[AddressBook (Level 3)]
into *PlanMySem* for our Software Engineering project. *PlanMySem* is a text-based (Command Line Interface)
scheduling/calendar application that caters to NUS students and staff who prefer to use a desktop application for
managing their schedule/calendar efficiently. *PlanMySem* offers the following features and benefits:

* Automatic creation of a planner that is synchronized to the NUS academic calendar for the current semester so you will
not have to waste time manually doing so.
* Flexible commands to facilitate easy creation, editing and deleting of items so you would enjoy a smooth experience
while using the application.
* A unique recursion system which takes into account special weeks such as recess week or reading week so as to allow
you to add recurring items efficiently.
* An intuitive tagging system for you to manage items productively.
* Optimized for you if you prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and/or are learning to work more
efficiently with CLI tools.
* Utilizes minimal resources on your machine while still allowing you to view your schedules swiftly.

== About this Portfolio

My role was to implement the automatic synchronization of *PlanMySem* with the academic calendar as well as the `view`
feature. The following sections illustrate my implementations in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have
contributed to the user and developer guides in relation to my implementations.

For ease of communication, this document will refer to lessons/activities/events/appointments that you might add into
the planner as _slots_.

Throughout this portfolio, there will be various icons used as described below.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

* *Main feature*: I implemented the automatic synchronization of *PlanMySem* with the academic calendar.
** What it does: Upon running *PlanMySem*, the planner is automatically initialized and synchronized with details
pertaining to the current academic semester. The current academic semester is dynamically generated based on the current
date. This enhancement allows *PlanMySem* to function as intended; as a planner for the academics.
** Justification: This enhancement is required as the other commands in *PlanMySem*, including the `view` command,
rely on the proper initialization of the current academic semester for their command functionalities. The current
academic semester is dynamically generated from the current date so as to ensure *PlanMySem* continues to work in the future.
** Highlights: This enhancement is critical to existing commands and commands to be added in future. Hence, it required
an in-depth analysis of design alternatives pertaining to the aspect of academic calendar generation. The chosen
implementation must be reliable indefinitely.

* *Minor features*:
** I added the `view` command and implemented the various types of planner views which will allow the user to view the
planner in different viewing formats.
** I also enhanced the parsing for `view` command to allow for more flexibility with the command parameters.

=== View the Planner : `view` / `v`
View the planner in a month/week/day view.

1. View the monthly calendar view of the current academic semester. +
Format: `view month`
2. View the weekly calendar view of the current academic week. +
Format: `view week [WEEK]` +
`[WEEK]` is valid if it is:

* Any number from 1 to 13 (as there is only week 1 to 13 in a semester).
* Any of the following text (case-insensitive): recess, reading, exam, examination.
[TIP]
You may add in the parameter `details` after `[WEEK]` to view the details of all _slots_ with respect to the `[WEEK]`. +
E.g. `view week 13 details` will allow you to view details of all _slots_ in week 13!

3. View the day view of a particular day in the academic semester. +
Format: `view day [DATE_OR_DAY_OF_WEEK]` +
`[DATE_OR_DAY_OF_WEEK]` is valid if it is:
* Any number from 1 to 7 (the numbers 1 to 7 corresponds to the days Monday to Sunday respectively).
* Any of the following text (case-insensitive): Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. +
The three-letter abbreviation of the days (e.g. mon, tue) is accepted as well.
* A date in the format of "dd-mm" or "dd-mm-yyyy" (e.g. 16-04 or 16-04-2019). The date must exist in the current semester.

[TIP]
You may omit `[WEEK]`/`[DATE_OR_DAY_OF_WEEK]` to view the calendar with respect to the current date! +
E.g. `view week` will allow you to view the current week and `view day` will allow you to view the current day! +
If you have added _slots_ to the planner, the expected output after successfully running `view week` will be similar to
the expected output shown in the figure below.

=== View feature

This feature presents the planner in different formats to the user. The available formats are the month view, week view,
and the day view. This section will detail how this feature is implemented.
{zwsp}

{zwsp}

==== Current Implementation

Upon invoking the `view` command with valid parameters (refer to https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T08-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc#view[UserGuide.adoc] for `view` usage),
a sequence of events is executed. For clarity, the sequence of events will be in reference to the execution
of a `view month` command. A graphical representation is also included in the Sequence Diagram below for your reference
when following through the sequence of events. The sequence of events are as follows:

1. Firstly, the `view month` command is passed into the `execute` function of `LogicManager` to be parsed.
2. `LogicManager` then invokes the `parseCommand` function of `ParserManager`.
3. `ParserManager` in turn invokes the `parse` function of the appropriate parser for the `view` command which in this case,
is `ViewCommandParser`.
[NOTE]
The `view` command can be parsed into only 3 general types of views which are the month, week or day view as
specified in the command parameter.
4. After parsing is done, `ViewCommandParser` would instantiate the `ViewCommand` object which would be returned to the `LogicManager`.
5. `LogicManager` is then able to invoke the `execute` function of the returned `ViewCommand` object.
6. In the `execute` function of the `ViewCommand` object, data will be retrieved from the `Model` component (i.e. retrieving data from the current `Semester`).
7. Now that the `ViewCommand` object has the data of the current semester, it is able to invoke the `displayMonthView` method.
8. With the output returned from the `displayMonthView`, the `CommandResult` object will be instantiated.
9. This `CommandResult` object would be returned to the `LogicManager` which then returns the same `CommandResult` object
back to the `UI` component.
10. Finally, the `UI` component would display the contents of the `CommandResult` object to the user. For this `view month`
command, the displayed result would be the monthly calendar view of all months in the current semester.

{zwsp}

The 3 general types of view (month, week, day) are generated by the methods `displayMonthView`, `displayWeekView`,
`displayDetailedWeekView`, `displayDayView` from the `ViewCommand` class and the implementation of these methods is
explained below.

`displayMonthView` method displays all the months of the current semester in a monthly calendar format. Each academic week
of the semester is also indicated in the display. The implementation of this method can be
broken down into 3 parts:

1. Print month header (e.g. January 2019) and calculate required amount of whitespace before the 1st of the month.
2. Print all days of the month using a loop.
   * Append academic week after each Saturday or last day of month.
3. Repeat parts 1 and 2 for every month in the semester.

`displayWeekView` method displays the weekly calendar format of a specified week. The implementation of this method can be
broken down into the following steps:

1. Print academic week header (e.g. Week 13 of Sem 2).
2. Retrieve all days of the week and for each day, retrieve its _slots_ into an `ArrayList`.
3. For each day, print the _slot_ details (only start time, end time and a shortened title) and remove the _slot_ from
the `ArrayList`.
4. Repeat step 3 until the `ArrayList` of _slots_ for each day is empty.

`displayDayView` method displays the details of all _slots_ of a specified day. The implementation of this method can be
broken down into 2 parts:

1. Retrieve all _slots_ for the specified day.
2. Print all details of each _slot_ found.

`displayDetailedWeekView` method displays the details of all _slots_ of a specified week since `displayWeekView` only shows
 a formatted and summarised week view. The implementation of this method can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Print academic week header (e.g. Week 13 of Sem 2).
2. Retrieve all days of the week.
3. For each day, print all details of all _slots_ via the `displayDayView` method.

==== Design Considerations

This section details our considerations for the implementation of the `view` feature.

===== Aspect: Functionality of `view week` command

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Option for user to display a formatted summarised week view or a detailed week view.
** Pros: The formatted summarised week view is uncluttered. User given the choice and flexibility for the week view.
** Cons: User is required to spend a little more time to specify an additional parameter in the `view week` command.

* *Alternative 2:* Only a single formatted week view which displays details of all _slots_ in the specified week.
** Pros: Efficient for the user as user is only required to enter a single command to view all details of all _slots_.
** Cons: The formatted week view will be too cluttered as there are too many _slots_ and lots of details. Formatting is
an issue as well as details of each _slot_ can be of varying lengths.

Alternative 1 was chosen to be implemented as it gives the user freedom of choice to select the degree of details to be
displayed in the output of the `view week` command. The output of alternative 1 is also less cluttered than alternative 2
and thus enhances the presentability of *PlanMySem*.
