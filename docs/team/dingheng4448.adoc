== PROJECT: PlanMySem

== Overview

My team and I have morphed the original https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S2/addressbook-level3[AddressBook (Level 3)]
into *PlanMySem* for our Software Engineering project. *PlanMySem* is a text-based (Command Line Interface)
scheduling/calendar application that caters to NUS students and staff who prefer to use a desktop application for
managing their schedule/calendar efficiently. *PlanMySem* offers the following features and benefits:

* Automatic creation of a planner that is synchronized to the NUS academic calendar for the current semester so you will
not have to waste time manually doing so.
* Flexible commands to facilitate easy creation, editing and deleting of items so you would enjoy a smooth experience
while using the application.
* A unique recursion system which takes into account special weeks such as recess week or reading week so as to allow
you to add recurring items efficiently.
* An intuitive tagging system for you to manage items productively.
* Optimized for you if you prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and/or are learning to work more
efficiently with CLI tools.
* Utilizes minimal resources on your machine while still allowing you to view your schedules swiftly.

== About this Portfolio

My role was to implement the automatic synchronization of *PlanMySem* with the academic calendar as well as the `view`
feature. The following sections illustrate my implementations in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

* *Major enhancement*: I implemented the automatic synchronization of *PlanMySem* with the academic calendar.
** What it does: Upon running *PlanMySem*, the planner is automatically initialized and synchronized with details
pertaining to the current academic semester. The current academic semester is dynamically generated based on the current
date. This enhancement allows *PlanMySem* to function as intended; as a planner for the academics.
** Justification: This enhancement is required as the other commands in *PlanMySem* rely on the proper initialization
of the current academic semester for their command functionalities. The current academic semester is dynamically
generated from the current date so as to ensure *PlanMySem* continues to work in the future.
** Highlights: This enhancement is critical to existing commands and commands to be added in future. Hence, it required
an in-depth analysis of design alternatives pertaining to the aspect of academic calendar generation. The chosen
implementation must be reliable indefinitely.

* *Major enhancement*: I added the `view` command and implemented the various types of planner views.
** What it does: The `view` command allows the user to view the planner in different viewing formats.
** Justification: This enhancement is vital as it is a requirement to view what is in the planner before managing the
individual items in the planner. The various view formats displays varying degrees of details to cater to the user's
preference.
** Highlights: The implementation of this feature was challenging as it required a lot of formatting to be able to
display a reasonably acceptable view. The various types of views each required a different style of formatting which
adds on to the difficulty.
** Credits: The monthly calendar view's implementation was inspired by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne's implementation
code which can be found https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/21function/Calendar.java.html[here].

* *Minor enhancement*: Enhance parsing for `view` command to allow for more flexibility with the command parameters.

=== Initialization of the Planner and its Semester

The `Planner` and its `Semester` has to be initialized for *PlanMySem* to work as all other features of *PlanMySem* would
interact with this `Semester` object. The initialization is automated and dynamic to ensure sustainability.

==== Current Implementation

Upon launching *PlanMySem*, the initialization of the `Planner` and its `Semester` would be implemented via two steps:

1. Automatically generate the academic calendar from the current date.
2. Setup current `Semester` from the academic calendar.

The academic calendar is dynamically generated by invoking the function `generateSemester` in the `Semester` class.
The function will first retrieve the current date from the system clock to determine which academic year it is.
As a new academic year starts from August, it can be determined from the month of the current date.

* If the current date is before August, the current academic year is "the previous year / current year". +
e.g. If the date is 25/3/2019, the academic year is "2018 / 2019".
* If the current date is after August, the current academic year is "the current year / next year". +
e.g. If the date is 25/8/2019, the academic year is "2019 / 2020".

After determining the academic year, the details of the semesters will be generated. All the weeks of the academic
year can be calculated from the first day of semester 1 since each semester has a fixed amount of weeks.

[NOTE]
Semester 1 of the academic year starts with an orientation week and will always begin from the first Monday of August.

* Semester 1 has 18 weeks (inclusive of orientation week) and semester 2 has 17 weeks.
* The vacation between semester 1 and 2 has 5 weeks.
* The vacation between academic years will have 12 or 13 weeks depending on the starting week of the next academic year.

Each week of the year will correspond to an academic week and this information will be stored in a `HashMap`. This
`HashMap` can be used to determine the academic week given a date (by finding out the week of the year for that date).
The figures below shows an example of the relation between academic week and the week of the year for academic year 2018/2019.

[#img-view]
.[.underline]#Weeks in academic year 2018/2019, Semester 1.#
image::Sem1.png[width="790"]

[#img-view]
.[.underline]#Weeks in academic year 2018/2019, Semester 2.#
image::Sem2.png[width="790"]

Hence, the information listed below can be determined from the current date.

* Current academic week
* Current academic semester
* Current academic year
* Number of weeks in current academic semester
* Start date of current academic semester
* End date of current academic semester

These information would be assigned to the `Semester` object upon initialization of the `Planner`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Generation of academic calendar

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Generate academic calendar by performing calculations from the current date.
** Pros: Generation of academic calendar is dynamic and will work for future dates.
** Cons: Computationally expensive as many operations have to be performed.

* *Alternative 2:* Retrieve academic calendar from a pre-generated file.
** Pros: Generation of academic calendar is efficient and not prone to calculation errors.
** Cons: Requires the pre-generated file which may be accidentally edited or deleted by the user.

=== View Month/Week/Day feature

This feature presents the planner in different formats. This section will detail how this feature is implemented.

==== Current Implementation

Upon entering the `view` command with valid parameters (refer to <<UserGuide#, UserGuide.adoc>> for `view` usage), the
following sequence of events is executed:

1. The `Parser` component parses the `view` command. It can be parsed into only 3 general types of views which are the
month, week or day view.
2. This results in a Command object which is executed.
3. The command execution will retrieve data from the `Model` (e.g. retrieving data from the current `Semester`).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to `Ui`.
5. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to display results, such as displaying help to
the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram upon executing the `view month` command.

.Interactions between components for the `view month` Command
image::ViewMonthSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
{zwsp}

The 3 general types of view (month, week, day) are generated by the methods `displayMonthView()`, `displayWeekView()`,
`displayDetailedWeekView()` and `displayDayView()` from the `ViewCommand` class.

`displayMonthView()` displays all the months of the current semester in a monthly calendar format. Each academic week
of the semester is also indicated in the display. The implementation of this function can be
broken down into 2 parts:

1. Print month header and calculate required amount of whitespace before the 1st of the month.
2. Print all days of the month using a loop.
   * Append academic week after each Saturday or last day of month.

`displayWeekView()` displays the weekly calendar format of a specified week. The implementation of this function can be
broken down into the following steps:

1. Print academic week header.
2. Retrieve all days of the week and for each day, retrieve its _slots_ into an `ArrayList`.
3. For each day, print the _slot_ details (only start time, end time and a shortened title) and remove the _slot_ from
the `ArrayList`.
4. Repeat step 3 until the `ArrayList` of _slots_ for each day is empty.

`displayDayView()` displays the details of all _slots_ of a specified day. The implementation of this function can be
broken down into 2 parts:

1. Retrieve all _slots_ for the specified day.
2. Print all details of each _slot_ found.

`displayDetailedWeekView()` displays the details of all _slots_ of a specified week since `displayWeekView()` only shows
 a formatted and summarised week view. The implementation of this function can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Print academic week header.
2. Retrieve all days of the week.
3. For each day, print all details of all _slots_ via the `displayDayView()` method.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Functionality of `view week` command

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Option for user to display a formatted summarised week view or a detailed week view.
** Pros: The formatted summarised week view is uncluttered. User given the choice and flexibility for the week view.
** Cons: User is required to spend a little more time to specify an additional parameter in the `view week` command.

* *Alternative 2:* Only a single formatted week view which displays details of all _slots_ in the specified week.
** Pros: Efficient for the user as user is only required to enter a single command to view all details of all _slots_.
** Cons: The formatted week view will be too cluttered as there are too many _slots_ and lots of details. Formatting is
an issue as well as details of each _slot_ can be of varying lengths.
